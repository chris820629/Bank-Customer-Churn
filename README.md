# Layoff-Prediction
## Topic Selection
We began exploring different datasets to address the question of when a company should execute layoffs. Unfortunately, for IPOs, the datasets we found contained less than 500 rows of relevant data. This seemed too small to create a robust machine learning model. We continued to explore different datasets regarding layoffs, but also began exploring the idea of creating a project regarding customer churn. One question to answer regarding customer churn is, what are the factors that lead to a customer either continuing or terminating their involvement (subscription, account, etc.) with the company. After viewing some datasets on telecom and bank customer churn, it seemed that these datasets had sufficient dimmensions (such as tenure and credit score for the bank datasets) and many rows 1000< to create a model. We will continue exploring this idea during the second class of our Final Project. Here is the link of the original dataset selected for our deep dive, [Churn of Bank Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers?resource=download).</br>
